Pok√©mon Crystal Minor- Crystal Disassembly Hack Retaining Compatibility

Credit to the pret team for the initial disassembly, another readme is included with more info on that, as well as installation instructions.
Brings balance to the Johto region. Not Kanto though, I'm not done there yet. Most trade evos have turned into level-up, friendship, or stone evos. I still have to re-add the water swarms from Gold and Silver that Crystal removed for... whatever reason... then add the fossils, add a couple events to get the remaining starters, give the GS Ball like in the VC release, put the Kanto Legendaries back in their dungeons, and do something special for Mew. After that, you'll be able to catch all 251 without trading! Although, you SHOULD be able to trade with vanilla Crystal games with the proper hardware.

Trainers and wild encounters have been spiced up, and the level curve was somewhat fixed. There's only so much I could do with this Dex, though. I also added a couple gatekeepers to make it easier to control the level curve. The rest, you can take a look for yourself! Feel free to use this as a base to make more hacks!
